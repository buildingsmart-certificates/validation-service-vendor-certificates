# validation-service-vendor-certificates

This is the public reposity of vendor certificates for use in the buildingSMART validation service. Given the nature of the content (certificates are essentially public keys) everyone has read access, but write access is restricted. Itâ€™s hosted separately of the main buildingSMART GitHub organization to prevent the org admins from having write permissions. Currently, only the the bSI-Bot user has write access and various branch protection rules are active to prevent unauthorized writes.
